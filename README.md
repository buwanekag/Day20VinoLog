Ever since the 1976 wine competition termed the "Judgment of Paris", American wine companies have finally been getting respect. In fact the number of wine producers in the United States has grown from 6,357 to 8,287 from 2009 to 2015. Even if each one of them only produced one type of wine each year, tracking what you've tasted would be impossible. So, we want to create an app that helps us remember what we've tasted, track what we have in our wine rack, and track what we want to taste.

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* Create an app that lists wines that you have tried, wines that you want to acquire, and wines that you have in your wine rack.
* Each wine should contain data including name, vintage (i.e. year), varietal (i.e. Cabernet, Merlot), company, our rating, purchase price, purchase date, consumed date, category (red, white, rose, sparkling (of each), etc), and a photo (from either the camera or the camera roll)
